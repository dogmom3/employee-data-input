# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## Description
My motivation in creating this file generator is to expand my knowledge with using Node.Js.
I built this project to assist in making a portfolio of employee data.
This will make it easy to see who is on your team and all of their info in one place.
I learned how to use Node.js and the inquirer package to help further my coding abilities.
